# #MeteorPress v1.0.0-RC1

# TL;DR


# Coding Style & Layout


# Current Status

Beta three is quite stable right now, but the customized page editor is not complete and does not save.  The first two betas worked well with auto-forms, current mission is to finish the page editor.  The file structure is still in very beta mode. :>

* [Main Site](http://meteorpress.org) (in maintenance mode atm)
* [Trello development board](https://trello.com/b/cMAulFo4/development)

* Installer works (/install).
    1. Installs admin email/password user (required, rest are skippable).
    2. Installs social login keys.
    3. Installs Google Analytics keys.
    3. Installs Kadira keys.
        * Coming soon: Rollbar & Atmosphere keys
    4. Allows customization of all settings (strings still mixed between hard code & 'constants' and non-databased).
    5. Offers to install default content (might not be done?).
    6. Eventually will offer theme & plug-in selection.
    * Caveat: I have been wrestling with getting it to intelligently run the installer when required (no config in database) without showing it to a client first.  Currently I think it is route based, I might have a solution in my head but execution of that may be a while.
* Administration
    * Configuration editor works but is quick-formed
    * News & article/post editor work as auto-forms.
    * Page editor is (soon to be super duper awesome) where I left off to work on [#OnePageWonder](http://github.com/idometeor/onepagewonder), I will return the autoform version as a fallback until complete as soon as I can
    * Post editor works via autoform
    * Roles editor, works and is meant to be extensible
    * Service key editors... are probably autoformed.
    * User editor has been designed (views: single, large cards, small cards, table) but lacks functionality
* MP Markdown
    * I wrote a really nice markdown parser before I found the GFM Javascript library.  I may use that instead, or alter my code a bit to more closely resemble it.
* Consumer output
    * Pages, posts & news will all be sensibly output if you manage to get them in. :)
    * Current semantic, unstyled output is presented in the following order:
        1. 3 most recent news items.
        2. Page title & summary data (so you can make sexy full-width front page designs predicatably w/bg image from page settings).  Audio & image attachments are working, I forget about videos & such.  Also, I forget if they are sorted or just alphabetical right now.
        3. A limited set of posts/articles are output, not sure if it's a togglable header list that expands summaries or not yet. :D
* Navigation
    * All navigation & routes are currently static. I am awesome at navigation design though, you can read a little story about the design and implication of a tertiary navigation system into my PHP CMS circa 2007 here, and the custom Smarty plug-in I wrote to assist it here.
    * The #MeteorPress navigation style is pretty well tested but I did introduce a bug right (in unrelated code! :|) before I finished (just something w/the icon).  It will be the standard navigation for MP until 2.0 or later but still has some indentation & icon work to do.
* File structure
    * Is b3 status which means chunky and kind of .. prone to wandering around.  In other words, it's a mess right now. :D  [#OnePageWonder](http://github.com/idometeor/onepagewonder) is much cleaner and the lessons I'm learning there will be transferred here before beta.3 is complete.
* Database structure
    * Is where I began and pretty thorough although I intend to drop autoforms/collection2/etc in favor of the new one I recently found (or might write my own).
* Dynamic Plug-ins and Themes
    * Integral features near and dear to my heart, but quite complex to work out in within the bounds of Meteor.  I am still mapping out the specifics in my head but am most certainly open to suggestions!

> Previous betas work just fine as skeletons and are in my tarballs repository.

> Thanks to a tip I read by Matt DeBergalis I anticipate ES6 modules to help me clean up the namespacing, load order & file system quite a bit!

# Installation

I am working on Meteor-style cURL installers that will allow one to choose between tarball, tarball with example data or Github install for both #MeteorPress and [#OnePageWonder](http://github.com/idometeor/onepagewonder).

Until then:

    $ git clone ssh://git@github.com:iDoMeteor/meteorpress.git
      * iDoMeteor is case sensitive (thx Github :p)!
    $ cd meteorpress
    $ meteor
    Open localhost:3000 (or localhost:3000/install?) in your browser and go from there!

Template Steps

     \- mpInstallFailure


# Procedural View

* Server side view

  * Server side code executes
      * Default configuration is read from ./opw/init
      * API loads and together with above provide everything needed to continue
      * Collections are instantiated, including general publications and allow/deny model
      * Global initialization tries to run installer if required but needs to init
      * Error methods are loaded (not used yet, may not be)
      * Iron Router loads (static, switching to Flow soon asap anyway)
      * Schemas are loaded (I went to town, going to switch packages though)
      * Strings are loaded (going to database eventually)
  * Library loading begins
      * Plug-in engine theoretically fires up ;> (ie; lib/plug-ins)
      * Server library fires
  * Server plug-ins load
  * Root level plugins load (where you might put custom, client-specific plugs on a set it & forget it profit oriented job)
  * Meteor "server environment" starts up on the server fires (meteorpress/server/main.js)
  * Meteor startup from the library fires (meteorpress/lib/main.js) (this doesn't log the env atm, so who knows)
  * Meteor.startup in meteorpress/server/main.js actually fires

* Client side load order

    * Defaults
    * Client init (GAnalytics lives here currently)
    * API
    * Collections
    * Global init
    * Global methods
    * Routes
    * Schemas
    * Strings
    * Global subscriptions (template subs on load ofc)
    * Plugin engine
    * Selected theme (typically /client in a Meteor project)
    * Installation check (obviously out of order)
    * Markdown parser
    * Theme engine (placeholder)
    * Lazy plugins (drop-ins, placeholder)
    * Main shared env
    * Meteor figures out if we're logged in and does role check

# Extraneous

All user profile objects can be counted on to provide:
    created     date

    image       string  *
    ips         array
    name        string

> May be null, otherwise it will have value
